Airplanes are played on checkered paper where you draw two identical borders, usually 10x10 squares. Each box is identified by a number on the X axis (from 1 to 10) and a letter on the Y axis (from A to J). The first border is your own, where three identical planes are placed without the opponent seeing their position. Planes are not allowed to overlap or go out of bounds. Each player will try to guess where the opponent's planes are in the second frame.
